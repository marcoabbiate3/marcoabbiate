# About

Hi, funny seeing you here. 

I'm Marco, a rising senior at the University of California, Berkeley. I'm double majoring in Mechanical Engineering and EECS 
(Electrical Engineering and Computer Science), with a passion for mechatronics, green technologies, and consumer electronics.

Outside of engineering, I love to go for long runs in nature, play soccer, listen to showtunes, cook, and play guitar. I would
love to use my knowledge of engineering to create a product that helps me with one of my other hobbies.

I'm always looking for new technologies to master, new problems to solve, and new people to learn from. Feel free to reach out if
you want to connect!

:)
Marco
