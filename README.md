Hi, I'm **Marco Abbiate**, a junior at UC Berkeley. I'm double majoring in Electrical Engineering (EECS) and Mechanical Engineering.
I have a passion for robotics, artificial intelligence, and IoT devices.

**UC Berkeley CS Projects**
1. Gitlet\
  I created a version control system much like git that contains much of the functionality like commit, branch, merge, and log. I also completed the extra credit
  by allowing users to fetch, pull, and push with remotes
2. Build Your Own World (BYOW)\
  I created a tile-based video game for CS61B's final project. The game is pseudorandomly generated, and allows players to move around the world, 
  turn lights on and off, select an avatar color and a theme for the world. The objective of the game is to make it safely out the door, but if 
  you bump into walls, the world gets darker, and darker...
